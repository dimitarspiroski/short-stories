            1: "In the fog-covered village of Elderglen, time was more than just a concept—it was a craft. At the edge of the cobbled square stood a crooked clock shop, filled with hundreds of timepieces. Every wall ticked with the rhythm of precision, each clock unique, each lovingly maintained by the village's oldest resident, Eliot Thorne.\n\nEliot was not just a clockmaker. He was a keeper of stories and a man bound by an unfulfilled promise. His workshop smelled of oil and cedar, and he was always seen bent over a bench, spectacles slipping down his nose as he repaired the heartbeats of machines.\n\nOne stormy evening, a girl named Mira wandered into his shop. She was drenched, barefoot, and clutching a broken pocket watch. Her parents had passed away the previous winter, and she had come to live with her aunt, who was often too busy to notice her. The watch had belonged to Mira’s father, and it had stopped the day he died.\n\n“I heard you fix things,” she said.\n\nEliot took the watch, examined it for a moment, and nodded slowly. “Some things,” he replied, “can be fixed. Others need to remember why they broke.”\n\nIntrigued by his answer, Mira returned the next day. And the next. Eliot began to teach her the art of clockmaking. She had nimble fingers and a natural intuition for gears and springs. In time, she became like an apprentice—and to Eliot, like family. But there was one clock he never let her near: an enormous grandfather clock, tucked behind velvet curtains, taller than a man, and silent as a grave. It hadn’t ticked in over fifty years, and Eliot never wound it. Until one night, when everything changed.",

            2: "It was just past midnight when Mira awoke to the strange feeling that something had shifted in the air. Though her room was warm, a chill ran through her bones. She crept downstairs and found the clock shop bathed in moonlight. Eliot stood in front of the forbidden clock, holding a brass key in one hand and a letter in the other.\n\n“I think it’s time,” he whispered, not turning around. “This clock... it’s not ordinary. It doesn’t count hours—it holds them.”\n\nMira stepped closer. The air around the grandfather clock shimmered faintly, as if time itself bent in its presence. The carvings on its wooden frame were unlike anything she had ever seen—strange, looping symbols that seemed to shift when not directly looked at.\n\nEliot handed her the key. “It will only start for someone it chooses. I've waited a long time to see if that someone might be you.”\n\nHands trembling, Mira inserted the key. The mechanism resisted at first, but then turned with a satisfying click. A deep, resonant tick echoed through the shop. The floor beneath them hummed. Lights flickered. And from the base of the clock, a hidden drawer slowly slid open.\n\nInside was a rolled-up parchment, bound in leather cord. Mira unrolled it to reveal a map—hand-drawn, aged, and covered in symbols similar to those carved on the clock.\n\n“This map,” Eliot said, voice low, “leads to something my grandfather discovered. Or tried to. A place where time flows differently. A fracture in the world. He called it ‘The Meridian.’ He never found it—but he believed someone in our bloodline would.”\n\nMira's eyes widened. “You think I’m meant to go?”\n\n“I don’t think,” Eliot said. “I know.”",

            3: "The next morning, Mira stood at the edge of Elderglen, the map folded in her satchel, the strange compass Eliot had given her in her palm. It didn’t point north, but to somewhere else entirely—something deeper. The villagers were still asleep. Eliot had packed her some bread, a flask of tea, and a small toolkit with the inscription: For the hands that mend time.\n\nHer first destination was the Forest of Hollow Pines. The map had marked it with a circle and the words “Where Time Breathes.” She walked all day, the trees growing denser, their bark twisted like they’d been frozen mid-motion. Occasionally, she noticed something strange—a bird flying backwards, a squirrel flickering like a broken film reel. Time was distorted here.\n\nDeeper in the forest, Mira found a sundial half-buried in moss. When she placed the compass on it, the ground trembled. A hidden mechanism activated, and a spiral staircase revealed itself beneath a collapsed tree. Without hesitation, she descended.\n\nThe tunnel below led to a cavern filled with floating gears, each turning without touching anything. In the center stood an archway of stone, carved with the same shifting symbols. The moment she approached, her pocket watch—her father’s—began to tick again.\n\nStepping through the arch, Mira found herself in a world bathed in golden light. The trees swayed in impossible directions. Rivers flowed in slow motion. And far on the horizon stood a tower, ticking like a heartbeat.\n\nIt was The Meridian.\n\nAnd she was not the first to arrive.\n\nA figure waited at the base of the tower—tall, cloaked, and holding a watch that looked exactly like hers.\n\n“Welcome, Mira Thorne,” the figure said. “We've been expecting you.”",

            4: "The figure stepped forward, removing their hood. To Mira’s shock, the face beneath was strangely familiar. It was an older version of herself. Not much older—but aged by time passed differently.\n\n“I followed the same map,” the older Mira said. “But I went astray. Now I’ve become the guardian of this place, waiting for the next version of me to arrive—and make the right choice.”\n\nMira felt her compass tug toward the tower. The air was electric with possibility. “What happens if I go in?”\n\n“You decide how time flows,” the older Mira said. “Fix the fracture, and time heals. Fail, and it loops forever.”\n\nWith resolve in her chest and her father's watch ticking strong, Mira stepped toward the tower. She had learned to repair clocks, to understand their heartbeats. Now, she would repair something much greater.\n\nTime itself.\n\nAnd so her journey began—not to escape time, but to understand and reshape it.\n\nThe clockmaker’s secret had found its rightful keeper at last.",

            1: "In the fog-covered village of Elderglen, time was more than just a concept—it was a craft. At the edge of the cobbled square stood a crooked clock shop, filled with hundreds of timepieces. Every wall ticked with the rhythm of precision, each clock unique, each lovingly maintained by the village's oldest resident, Eliot Thorne.\n\nEliot was not just a clockmaker. He was a keeper of stories and a man bound by an unfulfilled promise. His workshop smelled of oil and cedar, and he was always seen bent over a bench, spectacles slipping down his nose as he repaired the heartbeats of machines.\n\nOne stormy evening, a girl named Mira wandered into his shop. She was drenched, barefoot, and clutching a broken pocket watch. Her parents had passed away the previous winter, and she had come to live with her aunt, who was often too busy to notice her. The watch had belonged to Mira’s father, and it had stopped the day he died.\n\n“I heard you fix things,” she said.\n\nEliot took the watch, examined it for a moment, and nodded slowly. “Some things,” he replied, “can be fixed. Others need to remember why they broke.”\n\nIntrigued by his answer, Mira returned the next day. And the next. Eliot began to teach her the art of clockmaking. She had nimble fingers and a natural intuition for gears and springs. In time, she became like an apprentice—and to Eliot, like family. But there was one clock he never let her near: an enormous grandfather clock, tucked behind velvet curtains, taller than a man, and silent as a grave. It hadn’t ticked in over fifty years, and Eliot never wound it. Until one night, when everything changed.",

            2: "It was just past midnight when Mira awoke to the strange feeling that something had shifted in the air. Though her room was warm, a chill ran through her bones. She crept downstairs and found the clock shop bathed in moonlight. Eliot stood in front of the forbidden clock, holding a brass key in one hand and a letter in the other.\n\n“I think it’s time,” he whispered, not turning around. “This clock... it’s not ordinary. It doesn’t count hours—it holds them.”\n\nMira stepped closer. The air around the grandfather clock shimmered faintly, as if time itself bent in its presence. The carvings on its wooden frame were unlike anything she had ever seen—strange, looping symbols that seemed to shift when not directly looked at.\n\nEliot handed her the key. “It will only start for someone it chooses. I've waited a long time to see if that someone might be you.”\n\nHands trembling, Mira inserted the key. The mechanism resisted at first, but then turned with a satisfying click. A deep, resonant tick echoed through the shop. The floor beneath them hummed. Lights flickered.
